# ?? Air Quality Detection, Prediction & Health Advisory System

A complete, production-ready **Air Quality Monitoring System** that collects real-time air pollution data, analyzes historical trends, predicts future AQI using Machine Learning, and provides **health advisories** to users.

This project is designed for **academic submission (Minor/Major Project)** as well as **real-world deployment readiness**.

## ?? AQI Health Advisory Scale

| AQI Range | Air Quality | Health Impact |
|----------|------------|---------------|
| 0–50 | Good | Safe for all |
| 51–100 | Moderate | Sensitive people take care |
| 101–150 | Unhealthy (Sensitive) | Avoid long outdoor activity |
| 151–200 | Unhealthy | Health warning |
| 201–300 | Very Unhealthy | Serious risk |
| 301+ | Hazardous | Emergency |
